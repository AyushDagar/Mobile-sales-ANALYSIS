##  Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Performed inside Power BI using Power Query Editor:

- Removed irrelevant columns
- Changed data types (e.g., Date, Text, Whole Number)
- Removed duplicates and filtered out null values
- Merged related tables (Customer, Product, Region)
- Extracted Year, Month, Quarter from Date column
- Replaced values for consistency (e.g., region names)
- Created conditional columns for status/category

##  DAX Measures Used

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
Total Quantity = SUM(Sales[Quantity])
Sales LY = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
Sales Growth = [Total Sales] - [Sales LY]
Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([Sales Growth], [Sales LY])
Profit Margin = [Total Profit] / [Total Sales]
